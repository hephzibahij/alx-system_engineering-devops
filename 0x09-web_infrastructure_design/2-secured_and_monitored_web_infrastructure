We are adding 3 firewalls to provide multiple layers of protection to the web infrastructure, and to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
An SSL certificate is being added to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS to encrypt the traffic between the web server and the client's browser,
providing security and privacy.
3 monitoring clients are being added to collect data from different parts of the infrastructure, to detect and troubleshoot issues in real
time.
Firewalls are added to control and monitor traffic to and from the servers, which are essential for protecting the infrastructure against
malicious attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access.
HTTPS is being used to encrypt the traffic between the web server and the client's browser, to protect sensitive data, such as login
credentials, credit card information, and personal details, from being intercepted by third-party attackers.
Monitoring is used to keep track of the web infrastructure's performance, uptime, and security, and to detect any anomalies,
errors, or failures in real time.
The monitoring tool collects data through various methods, such as agent-based or agentless monitoring, log analysis, network
traffic analysis, and application performance monitoring.
To monitor the web server's QPS, we can use tools such as Apache JMeter, Siege, or Locust, which simulate multiple user
requests and measure the server's response time, throughput, and error rate.

Issues with the infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because it can create a single point of failure and increase the risk of SSL attacks,
such as man-in-the-middle attacks or SSL stripping.
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because it can create a bottleneck and reduce the scalability,
availability, and performance of the database, especially under high traffic or workload.
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem because it can create
a lack of redundancy, increase the risk of single points of failure, and reduce the fault tolerance and resilience of the infrastructure.
