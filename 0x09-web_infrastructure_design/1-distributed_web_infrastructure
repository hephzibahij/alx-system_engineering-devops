In this design, there are two servers, each with Nginx, Application Server, and MySQL. The Load Balancer distributes the incoming traffic 
between the two servers. The DNS points to the IP address of the Load Balancer.

The load balancer is configured with a round-robin algorithm, meaning it will distribute traffic evenly between the servers.

The load balancer is configured with an Active-Active setup, meaning both servers are active and serving traffic.

The database is set up as a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster. The Primary node is the server that receives all the writes from the 
application, while the Replica node(s) are servers that replicate the data from the Primary node. In case the Primary node fails, 
one of the Replica nodes can be promoted to Primary.

The issues with this infrastructure include the lack of security measures like a firewall or HTTPS, as well as the lack of monitoring. 
Additionally, if the Load Balancer or Primary node fails, the system will experience a Single Point of Failure (SPOF).

HAproxy is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm. This means that incoming requests are distributed evenly 
across the two application servers.
